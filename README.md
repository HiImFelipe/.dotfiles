# dotfiles
My personal Linux dotfiles for automation and sync between computers.

## Running

### 1- Download applications for your base distro

Currently my dotfiles only support arch-based distros

```bash
./arch-install-apps.sh
``` 

### 2- Setup the environment

```bash
./setup-environment.sh
```

## TODO

- Automate downloading GNOME extensions;
- Automate downloading Lutris games;
- Automate setting up a GNOME theme with no manual intervention;
